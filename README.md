# Topac

This project is an attempt to codify my own common configurations of
my Linux based work stations. Since it is very much influenced of my
own personal preferences I doubt that it would benefit of being shared
among developers, but who knows?

Topac stands for Top As Code, where Top is a
generalization of Desktop and Laptop.
